🚗 Car Diagnostics App — Authoritative Fork Handoff (Garage-Centric)
original_problem_statement
The user is building a deterministic, rule-based Car Diagnostics App with a locked architecture.
The agent’s role is strictly builder, not designer.
All diagnostic logic already exists and is immutable.
This fork resets the UX foundation to eliminate entropy and restore a clean, progressive diagnostic flow.
🔒 Core Constraints (Unchanged)
DO NOT modify:
/src/core/*
/src/diagnostics/*
No new diagnostic logic
No inferred rules
UI never decides outcomes
Engine is the sole authority
If unclear → leave TODO, do not guess
✅ What Exists at Fork Start
Fully implemented diagnostic engine
Immutable scoring, confidence, and rule system
Engine → UI wiring proven functional
Vehicle profile model exists
Local-first architecture (no backend)
❌ What Is Explicitly Removed
❌ Observations system
❌ Observations tab
❌ Observations affecting diagnostic flow
❌ Single-question / dropdown diagnosis
❌ Safety hard stops, acknowledgments, or panels
❌ Standalone Maintenance panel
These are not to be rebuilt.
🚘 Vehicle Profiles (Hard Gate)
Vehicle selector lives at the top of the app
Tap to:
Select existing profile
Create new profile
Delete profile
Profile requires:
Name
Make
Model
Switching profiles swaps all visible data:
Garage content
Saved diagnostics
Notes
Maintenance
No other controls in the selector.
🧰 My Garage (Primary Data Container)
My Garage replaces Observations, Maintenance, and History.
It contains internal tabs:
1️⃣ Notes / Memory
User-entered notes about what they:
heard
saw
felt
smelled
Optional metadata:
date noticed
intermittent / constant
conditions (driving, weather, temp, fuel level)
Notes:
do NOT affect diagnostics
can be edited, deleted, or marked resolved
Used only as contextual references at results time
2️⃣ Maintenance
Oil changes
Brakes
Component replacements
Mileage entries
Countdown / reminders allowed
No separate Maintenance panel
3️⃣ Saved Diagnostics
Completed diagnoses can be:
saved
exported
Saved results appear here per vehicle
Switching vehicles swaps diagnostic history
🔁 Diagnostic Flow (Restored & Deterministic)
How the flow starts
User taps “Diagnose”
Flow begins with the first diagnostic question
No “Run Diagnosis” button
No observation pre-selection
Flow behavior
Progressive, multi-step elimination
Questions are contextual and sequential
Yes / No / Unsure answers
No single-question conclusions
No random or dropdown diagnosis
Navigation
Back arrow:
returns to previous question
works from Results back into the flow
Start Over:
resets the current diagnostic session only
does NOT delete Garage data or vehicle info
⚠️ Safety (Minimal & Non-Disruptive)
One app-launch disclaimer only:
“Use diagnostics only while the vehicle is stationary.”
No safety panels
No acknowledgments
No flow interruption
📊 Results (Integrated with Garage)
Results display:
Top hypothesis
Confidence band
Supporting engine signals
Garage linkage
Results may reference:
relevant Notes
relevant Maintenance history
References are informational only
Results can be:
saved to Garage
exported
🔄 Post-Result Actions
Button: “I think it’s something else”
Dropdown options:
Re-run diagnosis excluding current top hypothesis (temporary)
Submit feedback to developer
Feedback / Export payload includes:
Vehicle info
Diagnostic answers
Result
User notes
Payload must be:
usable in V1
forward-compatible with V2
💰 Pro Features (Unchanged)
Known-good component-level exclusions only
(battery, alternator, caliper, fuel pump, etc.)
Per-run only
Warning required:
“May reduce accuracy or cause misdiagnosis.”
No system-level exclusions
No safety-critical components
🧭 Final Panel Structure
Top:
Vehicle selector
Panels:
Diagnose
Results
My Garage
Tips & Tricks
Settings
🛑 Execution Order (Strict)
Remove observations entirely
Collapse Maintenance into My Garage
Add Saved Diagnostics tab
Restore deterministic question flow
Implement Back + Start Over navigation
Link Results ↔ Garage context
Add post-result actions
Add Pro controls
Polish only
Role Reminder (Critical)
You are a builder.
Do not redesign.
Do not simplify.
Do not invent.
If something feels “missing,” leave a TODO and continue.
