# Car Diagnostics App (Scaffold)

This repository was scaffolded to match the **authoritative structure + file contracts** provided by the user.

## Status
- Scaffold only: directories + files + headers + TODOs
- No business logic implemented
- Do not modify `/src/core` or `/src/diagnostics` logic without explicit approval

## Next steps
- Implement build tooling (Vite/React/TS) as needed
- Fill in immutable logic and static definitions only when authorized
